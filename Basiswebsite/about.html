      <img src="images/emoji.png" alt="Emoji van mij zelf" class="alignright">
            <p>My name is Selina, I am a graphic and brand identity designer in Amsterdam and 
             my passion is creating designs that touch the audience and convey emotions.
 
             journey as a designer started as a child as I have
             always had a passion for art. I'm learning to draw and practice my skills, 
             and getting more and more into art. A few years later I discovered Photoshop and 
            Illustrator and started experimenting with them.
         
            When I discovered my passion for design, I decided to become a graphic designer
             and pursued my dream by learning theory and history and improving my skills in poster design, 
            logo design, and branding.
        
            At this point, I gained the confidence to show my skills and ideas to the world, 
            so I created a project called Nero Orange, I started doing projects at a small print shop for customers.
            Today, I help clients from all over the world by providing design services 
            and try to help more people connect their ideas with design.
         
            you want to combine your brand with design and deliver your
            brand values â€‹to your customers, I can help you, because 
            I say:<em> Our designs. Your growth.</em>
            I will help you develop your ideas and connect them with visuals.</p>
